# data-analytics
This repository contains several analysis projects that I did during learning or provided by some college faculties

In this project, I used a dataset which I get from the faculty of my institute. 
Performed several supervised classification ML algos on the dataset and compare their accuracies both maximum and average(prepare 5 models of each algo using different training data).
